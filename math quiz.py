First, the system will give you addition, subtraction
multiplication and division within 10, and you cannot use a calculator.

But I hope you can try to use mental arithmetic
Because addition and subtraction within 10 are relatively simple.

Of course, I don't mind you using a computer.
But if you use a calculator, then this game will be useless

Good luck.
